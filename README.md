# WeaponAnimationMenu

New release! Thank you all for the positive feedback lately this is one of the few scripts that I created a while back but forgot to release. I'm now releasing it with some changes I did, like a config file so you can set it up easily and customize it. You can change your aim animation and the animation when you pull out a weapon. Anyways enjoy this and look out for some more stuff soon!

# Features
* Gangster & hillbilly aim animations.
* Weapon drawing animations.
* Easy config.
